                <p>Bomb, Bottle, Fire is an interactive reimagining of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors," 
                    placing it in a uniquely stylized digital world. The project explores how familiar mechanics 
                    can be transformed through visual storytelling and sound design, inviting players to engage 
                    with the game in a fresh and unexpected way. Every visual asset was designed in Photoshop to 
                    achieve a nostalgic, pixelated aesthetic reminiscent of early video games. The interactive 
                    prototype was built using Figma, while sound effects and music were assembled in Premiere Pro,
                     blending and remixing iconic themes from classic gaming history to reinforce the retro-inspired 
                     experience.</p>

                    Cave Rave was designed to foster a safe and immersive space 
                    for emerging figures within the Bay Area's techno scene, transforming 
                    an unconventional location into a vibrant celebration of underground electronic music. 
                    The event sought to push the boundaries of traditional nightlife, blending raw, industrial 
                    aesthetics with DIY sound and lighting. I contributed to the event's visual identity by 
                    co-designing the flyer in Photoshop and managed its presence on Resident Advisor, overseeing
                     ticket sales, guest lists, advertising, and communications. Additionally, I played a hands-on
                      role in the event's production, setting up the lighting rig and generator to create an atmospheric
                       and high-energy environment. Cave Rave was featured twice in 
                       The <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/09/secret-sutro-baths-rave-cave-san-francisco-is-back/">SF Standard</a>, 
                       named the top event in the Bay Area for its weekend on <a href="https://ra.co/events/2070573">Resident Advisor</a>, 
                       and recognized as an RA Pick. I collaborated with Cameran Ford, Ambar F. Marquez, and Elan Hebert.</p>

            <p class="gallery-description">Home is a visual exploration of personal spaces and the ways 
                in which they reflect the identities of those who inhabit them. Through intimate, 
                documentary-style photography, the project seeks to capture the essence of my closest 
                friends by observing the way they curate and arrange their environments. Over several 
                visits spanning weeks, I documented each space with a DSLR, taking over a thousand photos 
                to authentically encapsulate the details and atmosphere of their homes. The final series was 
                distilled to 9s carefully selected images, refined and color-graded in Lightroom to enhance 
                their emotional and aesthetic depth. Natalie Cohen is featured.
